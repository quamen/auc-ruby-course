- Lets look a few things you can do with Ruby (DEMO)
  - Archaeopteryx using Ruby to control a midi device (garage band or reason?)
  - CLEAR, Ruby as a trading platform for Australia's Grain Industry
  - Twitter, instant world wide communication
    - New York plane crash, the best photos from the incident were found on Twitter - news pic
    - Incredible, billion dollar news companies cant beat the speed of news Twitter can provide
    - We'll be building something to work with Twitter a bit later on :)
  - Something a bit closer to home: http://yellowlab.com.au/, Yellow Pages, Rails application developed by Sensis
    - Piloting new features for the official yellowpages site.
  
- Mac OS X used as the development platform for all of these applications
  - Some really amazing things have and continue to be built
  - Allows for great integration with Mac OS X, eg:
    - Domain and Keychain Authentication via Mac OS X/server
    - Hardware accelerated multimedia processing via Core Image/Animation/Video/Audio
    - Addressbook, Calendar and MobileMe application integration

- The Ruby Value
  - There's a whole world-wide industry out there developing Ruby based applications
  - Exciting companies, early adopters, start ups, corporations, are all getting in on it
  - Competitive edge using a simple, dynamic and modern language
    - Increased development speed
      - Faster time to market
      - Small development teams
      - Lower development costs
  - Rails has been such a big catalyst for the language
    - We'll be doing some Rails work a bit later on as well :)
  - Large community support with many conferences, books, user groups, and more
    - Major US and European OReilly conferences and with many smaller regional ones as well

- General Course Agenda
  - Ruby, the language and platform (most of today)
    - Assume no knowledge of the language and start from the beginning
    - Will assume you're familiar with software development and have experience with at least one language
    - Ruby is an easy language to get started with, but has plenty of depth to master
      - Today we'll learn the language, standard libraries, and get started writing programs in Ruby
      - Tomorrow we'll cover advanced/awesome topics such as meta programming and domain specific languages
  - RubyCocoa
    - Ruby's excellent integration with Mac OS X/Cocoa
    - This afternoon
  - Ruby on Rails
    - Web framework and a major catalyst for Ruby's popularity
    - Integration with databases
    - Tomorrow afternoon
  - ... and we'll be building some things along the way
    - Command line Twitter client
    - Mac OS X Desktop Twitter client using RubyCocoa
      - (http party, Twitter gem and a table, perhaps some animation somewhere?)
    - Image processing RubyCocoa application, and will convert it into a
      - Rails application, file uploads reusing the RubyCocoa processing images using Core Image
    - Some free break time to experiment, ask questions

- So What is Ruby?
  - Invented by Yukihiro “matz” Matsumoto in Japan 1995
  - From ruby-lang.org: "Ruby is... a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write."
  - Interpreted, dynamic language
    - No separate compilation/build phase
  - Dynamically typed
    - no declaration of types when you reference objects
      - no compile time type checking - its all done at runtime
        - lets you do some very interesting things :)
        - but your code needs to be well exercised - BDD/TDD is really important 
  - Blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming
    - Students will notice features from other languages along the way, particularly Smalltalk and Perl
  - Object Oriented - absolutely everything is an object
    - Even fundamental types (1.times, "hello".upcase!)
  - Message based (.send(:sym) is the same as a method invocation)
  - Free, free as in speech, not beer
    - Can be used commercially, can be modified, distributed to your hearts content
  - Dynamic runtime
    - Can define classes and methods at runtime, and on the fly
      - Can even catch calls for methods that don't exist and define them as needed
    - Can write (new) domain specific languages that better capture a business domain
      - music (arx)
      - software construction (rake)
      - software deployment (sprinkle)
      - software testing (rspec)
      - database schemas and queries (active record queries and migrations)
      - other DSLs? the common part - its all Ruby code


- Ruby Flavours
  - MRI 'Matz' Ruby
    - Current stable release is 1.8.7, Ruby 1.9 is the current development release
    - Written in C, standard library written in C and Ruby
  - JRuby, Rubinius, IronRuby are all alternate implementations based off of 1.8.x
    - JRuby, Java implementation of Ruby, Ruby.NET/CLR are .NET implementations
    - Rubinius is a Smalltalk blue book inspired implementation, VM in C++, rest in Ruby
    - Various levels of support
      - JRuby supports 1.8.x completely, runs Rails and can be pretty quick, all others are still in active development
    - Currently JRuby is the only implementation providing native threads
      - Even MRI still only uses green threads - advantages and disadvantages
  - Apple funding development of its own Ruby interpreter implementation
    - MacRuby, which is built on top of Cocoa
    - Currently under development, will support Ruby 1.8 and 1.9
    - Toll free bridging to Cocoa types, Cocoa garbage collection and direct integration with Cocoa, XCode and IB.
      - No type nor method signature conversion penalty, will be very fast
      - Native Cocoa Threads

  - Modules
    - Multiple inheritance (non)support in Ruby
      - Dynamic language alleviate type casting issues in other languages such as Java
      - Duck typing rules
        - If the receiver responds to a method, it can be called without requiring any type changes

      - included
      - method_added
    - Class
      - inherited
      - method_added
  - Continuations (brief explanation, not a commonly used Ruby feature)
    - Continuations allow for the execution and call stack to be paused, serialized to an object, and continued later
    - Unfortunately cannot yet be serialized in Ruby 1.8, Rubinius and Ruby 1.9
  - Method lookup and dispatch
    - method_missing
  - Constant lookup and dispatch
    - const_missing

    - Essentially an extension of Ruby's syntax
    - Examples such as 
      - rspec, sprinkle, rake, active record/migrations, builder, markaby, and others
  - The meta/singleton/eigen- class
    - _why? :)
    - Allows you to define methods on a particular object instance or class rather than its class (its a meta class thats transparent between the receiver and its real class)
    - Accessing and defining methods in the meta-class
