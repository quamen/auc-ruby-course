Exploring the Address Book with Ruby.

Start with the SecondRubyCocoaApp.rb file in the 01 First Ruby Cocoa App directory.

Using the Xcode documentation browser look up the ABAddressBook class.

Use the ABAddressBook class documentation to figure out which framework is required to work with ABAddressBook and include it in your application with the OSX.require_framework command.

In Objective-C if you want to access your personal record within the shared address book object you would use the following code:

  ABPerson *aPerson = [[ABAddressBook sharedAddressBook] me];

If you've never seen the Objective-C message passing syntax before this might be a little bit confusing.

What we are doing is asking ABAddressBook for the sharedAddressBook object and then asking it for me.

Try and figure out how to write this same line of code in Ruby and display your own address book entry on the screen.

It's easier than you might think.

Once you've done that, figure out how to display the different groups within your Address Book along with individual attributes of the first person in the first group.

If you get stuck the AddressBook.rb file in this directory contains a solution.
