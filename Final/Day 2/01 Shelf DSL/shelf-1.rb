# Version 1
#
# - Including rubygems/active for class accessor
# - Defined a base Shelf class which will hold all of the items sitting on the shelf.
# - Instance eval'd the block passed to the constructor, with a few place holder methods for handling the definitions of dvd and book.
# - Open up Object, add a method for defining a shelf in global namespace, for the moment, lets store the result in a class variable
# - Require/parse our data
# - Inspect the shelf
#

  def dvd(options = {}); end
  def book(options = {}); end
end

class Object
  def shelf(&block)
    Shelf.current = Shelf.new(&block)
