04. Lets look a few things you can do with Ruby (DEMO)
  - Archaeopteryx using Ruby to control a midi device (garage band or reason?)
  - CLEAR, Ruby as a trading platform for Australia's Grain Industry
  - Twitter, instant world wide communication
    - New York plane crash, the best photos from the incident were found on Twitter - news pic
    - Incredible, billion dollar news companies cant beat the speed of news Twitter can provide
    - We'll be building something to work with Twitter a bit later on :)
  - Something a bit closer to home: http://yellowlab.com.au/, Yellow Pages, Rails application developed by Sensis
    - Piloting new features for the official yellowpages site.
    
05. Mac OS X used as the development platform for all of these applications
  - Some really amazing things have and continue to be built
  - Allows for great integration with Mac OS X, eg:
    - Domain and Keychain Authentication via Mac OS X/server
    - Hardware accelerated multimedia processing via Core Image/Animation/Video/Audio
    - Addressbook, Calendar and MobileMe application integration

06. The Ruby Value
  - There's a whole world-wide industry out there developing Ruby based applications
  - Exciting companies, early adopters, start ups, corporations, are all getting in on it
  - Competitive edge using a simple, dynamic and modern language
    - Increased development speed
      - Faster time to market
      - Small development teams
      - Lower development costs
  - Rails has been such a big catalyst for the language
    - We'll be doing some Rails work a bit later on as well :)
  - Large community support with many conferences, books, user groups, and more
    - Major US and European OReilly conferences and with many smaller regional ones as well

07. General Course Agenda
  - Ruby, the language and platform (most of today)
    - Assume no knowledge of the language and start from the beginning
    - Will assume you're familiar with software development and have experience with at least one language
    - Ruby is an easy language to get started with, but has plenty of depth to master
      - Today we'll learn the language, standard libraries, and get started writing programs in Ruby
      - Tomorrow we'll cover advanced/awesome topics such as meta programming and domain specific languages
  - RubyCocoa
    - Ruby's excellent integration with Mac OS X/Cocoa
    - This afternoon
  - Ruby on Rails
    - Web framework and a major catalyst for Ruby's popularity
    - Integration with databases
    - Tomorrow afternoon
  - ... and we'll be building some things along the way
    - Command line Twitter client
    - Mac OS X Desktop Twitter client using RubyCocoa
      - (http party, Twitter gem and a table, perhaps some animation somewhere?)
    - Image processing RubyCocoa application, and will convert it into a
      - Rails application, file uploads reusing the RubyCocoa processing images using Core Image
    - Some free break time to experiment, ask questions
