- Lets look a few things you can do with Ruby (DEMO)
  - Archaeopteryx using Ruby to control a midi device (garage band or reason?)
  - CLEAR, Ruby as a trading platform for Australia's Grain Industry
  - Twitter, instant world wide communication
    - New York plane crash, the best photos from the incident were found on Twitter - news pic
    - Incredible, billion dollar news companies cant beat the speed of news Twitter can provide
    - We'll be building something to work with Twitter a bit later on :)
  - Something a bit closer to home: http://yellowlab.com.au/, Yellow Pages, Rails application developed by Sensis
    - Piloting new features for the official yellowpages site.
    
    
- Mac OS X used as the development platform for all of these applications
  - Some really amazing things have and continue to be built
  - Allows for great integration with Mac OS X, eg:
    - Domain and Keychain Authentication via Mac OS X/server
    - Hardware accelerated multimedia processing via Core Image/Animation/Video/Audio
    - Addressbook, Calendar and MobileMe application integration
